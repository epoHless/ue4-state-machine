# ue4-state-machine

This project was my first dive into UE4 C++ development.

This project aimed to provide a simple knowledge around Finite State Machines and their technical application in a character controller.

---

The character controller features different states:

- Idle
- Running
- Walking
- Focusing (kind of an attack stance, you can attack only during this state)
- Attacking
- Jumping
- Rolling

---

This project comes with a test scene in which you can roam on some platforms and kill simple enemies to test out the different features.
